# Graph-of-Experts (GoE) Language Model

This program implements a **Graph-of-Experts (GoE) Language Model**, a sophisticated neural network architecture designed for next-token prediction. It's a variation of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept, where instead of a single gating mechanism choosing experts in one shot, a **routing controller** dynamically builds a "path" by sequentially selecting experts or deciding to terminate the path.

1. **Core Task: Language Modeling**  
     
   * The ultimate goal is to predict the next word (token) in a sequence, given the preceding words. This is a standard self-supervised learning task for language models.  
   * The loss function for this primary task is `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`.

   

2. **Input Processing:**  
     
   * **Tokenization & Vocabulary:** Text is tokenized (e.g., `text.lower().split()`), and a `Vocabulary` class maps these tokens to numerical IDs, handling `<pad>`, `<unk>`, `<bos>`, `<eos>` special tokens.  
   * **Embedding:** Input token IDs are converted into dense vector representations using `nn.Embedding`.  
   * **Positional Encoding:** Standard sinusoidal positional encodings (`PositionalEncoding` class) are added to the embeddings to give the model information about token order. The embeddings are scaled by `math.sqrt(embed_dim)`.  
   * **Input Normalization:** `nn.LayerNorm` is applied to the initial representations after positional encoding.

   

3. **Expert Modules (`Expert` class):**  
     
   * These are the "workhorse" components of the model. The program defines `num_experts` of them.  
   * Each `Expert` consists of a stack of `expert_layers` (default 4\) custom Transformer encoder-like blocks.  
   * Each block uses a `GatedAttention` module (a `nn.MultiheadAttention` layer whose output is combined with the input via a learned gate: `sigmoid(gate_linear(cat(x, attn_out))) * attn_out`) followed by a feed-forward network (FFN: Linear \-\> GELU \-\> Dropout \-\> Linear).  
   * It employs a Pre-LN (LayerNorm before attention/FFN) structure within each block: `x = x + dropout(attn(norm1(x)))`, then `x = x + dropout(ffn(norm2(x)))`.  
   * **Adaptive Gate:** Each expert also features an "adaptive gate" applied to its overall output. This gate (`sigmoid(linear(mean_processed_output))`) modulates between the expert's processed output and its original input: `gated_output = gate * processed_output + (1-gate) * original_input_to_expert`.  
   * Each expert has a learnable `tag` vector, which is added to its final gated output.

   

4. **Routing Controller (`RoutingController` class):**  
     
   * This module is the "brain" that decides how information flows through the experts. It's trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL)-like principles.  
   * At each step of building a path, it takes a summary of the current sequence representation (`x_summary`). This summary is created by concatenating the mean-pooled and max-pooled token representations from the current active sequence (`embed_dim * 2` total dimension).  
   * It outputs logits for `num_experts + 1` actions: selecting one of the `num_experts` or a special "terminate path" action.  
   * **Q-values:** It maintains learnable `q_values` (a `nn.Parameter` of size `num_experts + 1`) which are added to the raw logits from its feed-forward layers. The result (`logits + q_values`) is then passed through `nn.LayerNorm` and clamped (`min=-10, max=10`) to produce the final logits.  
   * **Visit Counts:** It considers `visit_counts` for each expert within the current sample's path. If an expert has been visited `max_visits_per_expert` times, it's masked out (logit set to \-inf, cannot be selected again for that sample in that path). The termination action is not subject to this visit count masking.

   

5. **Dynamic Path Forward Pass (`GoEModel.forward`):**  
     
   * The model iteratively builds a path for each sample in the batch, up to `max_path_len` (default 3).  
   * **Routing Decision:** In each iteration:  
     * The `RoutingController` produces final logits.  
     * During training (`self.training` is True), `F.gumbel_softmax` with `hard=True` is used to make a differentiable (soft selection, but output is one-hot like) of an expert or termination. The Gumbel temperature `tau` anneals from `gumbel_tau_init` (e.g., 2.0) towards a minimum (e.g., 0.1) over training steps.  
     * During evaluation/inference, it takes the `argmax` of the logits and converts it to a one-hot vector.  
   * **Path Execution:**  
     * If "terminate" is chosen, the path for that sample ends, and its current representation is used as its final representation.  
     * If an expert is chosen, the sample's representation is passed through that specific expert. The output becomes the new current representation for the next routing step.  
     * `visit_counts` and the actual `paths` taken (sequence of expert indices or termination markers) are recorded for each sample.  
   * The process continues until termination is chosen for a sample, `max_path_len` is reached, or all samples in the "active" set (those not yet terminated) are processed.  
   * The final representation for each sample (after its path concludes) is mean-pooled across the sequence length, normalized (`final_norm`), and then passed to an `output_lm_head` (a linear layer) to produce logits over the vocabulary for next-token prediction.  
   * The discount factor for Q-learning also anneals during training (e.g., from 0.9 to 0.99).

   

6. **Training and Loss Components:**  
     
   * **Main LM Loss:** `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` between predicted logits and target token IDs (calculated in the `ContinuousLearningWorker`).  
   * **Router Reinforcement (Q-Loss):**  
     * A reward is calculated: `lm_rewards = -CrossEntropyLoss(logits.detach(), targets, reduction='none')`.  
     * **Path Length Penalty:** This reward is then penalized by path length: `final_rewards = lm_rewards - path_reward_penalty_coef * path_lengths`.  
     * The `reward_stat` (a `RunningStat` object) normalizes these `final_rewards`, which are then clamped to `[-1.0, 1.0]`.  
     * The `_compute_q_loss` function implements a Q-learning update for the router's `q_values`. It tries to make the Q-value of the chosen action closer to `normalized_clamped_reward + discount_factor * max_q_next_state.detach()`. This loss is scaled by `Q_LOSS_COEF` (e.g., 0.01).  
   * **Router Entropy (`total_ent`):** The entropy of the router's output probability distribution is maximized (by minimizing its negative). This encourages exploration. The coefficient for this loss (`ROUTER_ENTROPY_COEF`, e.g., 0.03) anneals towards a small minimum during training.  
   * **Diversity Loss (`_compute_diversity_loss`):** This loss encourages two things:  
     * High entropy in the average probability distribution over experts (across the batch, for experts only).  
     * Low variance in the actual usage proportion of experts (load balancing). This loss is scaled by `DIVERSITY_LOSS_COEF` (e.g., 0.02).  
   * **Contrastive Loss (`_compute_contrastive_loss`):** Applied to the outputs of the *experts* that were activated in the batch. It aims to make the (mean-pooled, L2-normalized) representations produced by different activated experts more dissimilar from each other, encouraging specialization. This loss is scaled by `CONTRASTIVE_LOSS_COEF` (e.g., 0.05).  
   * **Auxiliary Path Losses:** These use `final_summary.detach()` as input, so they don't backpropagate into the main path computation but serve as auxiliary prediction tasks.  
     * `path_optimizer`: A linear layer predicts the length of the path taken. Trained with `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` against the actual path length (0 to `max_path_len`).  
     * `meta_controller`: A linear layer predicts two values: number of unique experts used and path length. Trained with `nn.MSELoss`.  
   * **Total Loss (in `ContinuousLearningWorker`):** `(task_loss_val - ent_coef_val * router_ent_val + aux_loss_sum) / grad_accum_steps`. `aux_loss_sum` includes diversity, Q, contrastive, path, and meta losses with their respective coefficients.

   

7. **Optimization (`ContinuousLearningWorker`):**  
     
   * **Optimizer:** `AdamW`.  
     * **Parameter Groups:** The optimizer is configured with different parameter groups for base model parameters, router parameters, and expert parameters. Each group can have a different learning rate multiplier (`router_lr_mult`, `expert_lr_mult`) relative to the base `learning_rate`.  
   * **LR Scheduler:** `CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts` is used after an initial `WARMUP_STEPS` period.  
   * **Dynamic LR Adjustment:** A `current_lr_factor` (initially 1.0) scales the learning rates of all parameter groups. If the gradient norm exceeds a threshold (e.g., `2.5 * gradient_clip_norm`), this factor is reduced by `LR_FACTOR` (e.g., 0.999), down to a minimum (e.g., 0.1).  
   * **Gradient Clipping:** `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` is applied with `GRADIENT_CLIP_NORM` (e.g., 0.3).  
   * **Gradient Accumulation:** Gradients are accumulated for `EFFECTIVE_BATCH_SIZE // BATCH_SIZE` steps before an optimizer step.

   

8. **GUI and Visualization (`MainWindow`, `DiagramWidget`, etc.):**  
     
   * The PyQt5 GUI provides:  
     * Controls for hyperparameters, including new ones like `path_reward_penalty_coef`, `router_lr_mult`, `expert_lr_mult`, and `total_steps`.  
     * A `DiagramWidget` to visualize the model architecture (Input, Embed+Pos, Router, Experts, LM Head) and animate the data flow for a single sample (highlighting active nodes and connections, showing router probabilities, current path, and intermediate representations).  
     * Plots (using `pyqtgraph`) for training/validation loss, validation perplexity, average path length, router entropy.  
     * Statistics on expert usage frequency (bar chart) and pathway frequency (text list of most common paths).  
     * A 3D visualization (`pyqtgraph.opengl`) of common paths, showing connections between a conceptual start node, expert nodes, and an end node.

**Algorithm Potential:**

* **Increased Model Capacity with Controlled Computation:** Like standard MoE models, this architecture allows for a very large total number of parameters (many experts), but only a subset (those on the chosen path) are activated for any given input. This can lead to more powerful models without a proportional increase in inference cost compared to a dense model of the same total size.  
* **Dynamic Computation Allocation:** The model can theoretically learn to use shorter paths (less computation) for "easier" inputs and longer, more complex paths through multiple experts for "harder" inputs. The path length penalty in the Q-learning reward explicitly encourages efficiency.  
* **Expert Specialization:** The combination of the contrastive loss, the adaptive gates within experts, and the routing mechanism might encourage experts to specialize in different sub-tasks or types of information processing. The "path" itself could represent a learned "program" or reasoning chain.  
* **Improved Interpretability (Potentially):** Compared to monolithic black-box models, observing which experts are chosen and in what sequence (the path) can offer insights into the model's decision-making process. The GUI is built to facilitate this.  
* **Hierarchical/Sequential Processing:** Unlike a simple MoE where experts are chosen once, the sequential nature of path building allows for a more nuanced, multi-step processing of information.  
* **Regularization and Robustness:** The various auxiliary losses (entropy, diversity, Q-loss, path prediction) can act as regularizers, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable models. The Q-learning aspect aims to make the routing decisions more "intelligent" over time. The dynamic LR adjustment based on gradient norm can also contribute to training stability.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

* **Training Stability and Complexity:** Training such a model is significantly more complex than a standard dense Transformer. Balancing the numerous loss components (each with its own coefficient, some of which anneal) and ensuring the RL-like router training converges effectively is challenging.  
* **Load Balancing:** Ensuring all experts are utilized and learn meaningful representations is a persistent challenge in MoE-type systems. If the router collapses to using only a few experts, the benefits are lost. The diversity loss, visit count mechanism, and router entropy loss attempt to mitigate this.  
* **Router Overhead:** The router itself performs computations at each step of path generation. If paths become very long, this overhead could be non-negligible.  
* **Optimal Path Length and Structure:** It's not guaranteed that the model will learn optimally structured paths or that `max_path_len` is set appropriately for all tasks. The path length penalty in the Q-reward directly addresses this.  
* **Credit Assignment for Router:** The Q-loss relies on rewards derived from the final LM task (plus path penalty). This is a sparse and delayed reward signal for the router, making credit assignment difficult, especially for early decisions in a long path. Annealing discount factor and Gumbel tau are techniques to manage this.

In summary, this is a research-level, advanced language model architecture that combines ideas from Transformers, Mixture of Experts, and Reinforcement Learning to create a system capable of dynamic, conditional computation. Its potential lies in building larger, more efficient, and potentially more interpretable models, but it comes with significant training complexity. The detailed GUI is a valuable tool for understanding and debugging such a complex system.

# Analysis

## Conceptual Soundness

Conceptually, this model makes sense within the expected and correct behavior of such an advanced architecture. It attempts to combine several powerful ideas into a cohesive system.

* **Dynamic Computation:** The core idea of adapting the computational path (sequence and number of experts) based on the input is a strong and desirable trait. Not all inputs require the same amount of processing. This is analogous to how humans might spend more cognitive effort on complex problems. The path length penalty in the Q-reward directly encourages this.  
* **Expert Specialization:** The architecture is designed to encourage experts to specialize. This is achieved through:  
  * **Routing:** Different inputs (or intermediate states) can be routed to different experts.  
  * **Contrastive Loss:** Explicitly pushes *activated* expert outputs to be different from each other, incentivizing them to learn distinct functions.  
  * **Expert Tags:** The small learnable `tag` per expert could further aid in their unique identification and behavior.  
  * **Adaptive Gates within Experts:** Allows each expert to modulate its influence based on its own processed output, potentially leading to finer-grained specialization.  
* **Reinforcement Learning for Control:** Using an RL-like mechanism (Q-values, rewards derived from task performance and path length) to train the `RoutingController` is a sensible approach for learning a policy that makes sequential decisions. The Gumbel-Softmax allows for differentiable exploration during training, with an annealing temperature.  
* **Auxiliary Losses as Regularizers/Guidance:**  
  * **Router Entropy & Diversity Loss:** Crucial for preventing router collapse (always picking the same expert or path) and ensuring load balancing, which are common issues in MoE-like systems. Router entropy coefficient also anneals.  
  * **Path Optimizer & Meta Controller:** These can be seen as forms of regularization or auxiliary tasks that help the router learn more meaningful path characteristics. Since they operate on detached summaries, their primary role is likely to provide signals that indirectly influence the Q-learning process or serve as analytical tools.  
* **Hierarchical Processing (via Sequential Paths):** The sequential nature allows for the possibility of experts building upon each other's outputs, forming a processing pipeline. This is a step beyond typical MoE models where experts often operate in parallel on the same input.

## Expert Visit Order

***Is the order of expert visiting even important, and worth optimizing?***

**Yes, the order of expert visiting is potentially very important and, in this architecture, is explicitly designed to be optimized.**

* **Why Order Matters:**  
  1. **State Evolution:** The representation `active_x` evolves as it passes through experts. Expert B receives the output of Expert A (or a sequence ending in A), not the original input. If Expert A performs syntactic parsing and Expert B performs semantic disambiguation based on syntax, the order `A -> B` is critical and different from `B -> A`.  
  2. **Compositionality:** The model could learn to compose expert functions in specific sequences. For example, `Expert_Syntax -> Expert_Coreference -> Expert_Sentiment`. Reordering these would likely yield different and less useful results.  
  3. **Conditional Logic:** The router's decision at step `t+1` is based on the output of the expert chosen at step `t`. This implies that the path history (and thus order) influences future choices.  
* **How it's Optimized (or attempted):**  
  1. **Router's Q-Learning:** The Q-values learn the "value" of choosing an expert *given the current state*. The overall sequence of choices (the path) that leads to a high final reward (low LM loss, appropriate path length) will be reinforced. This implicitly optimizes the order.  
  2. **Path Optimizer & Meta Controller:** While these directly predict aggregate path properties, they operate on the `final_summary` which is a result of the entire ordered path. Their influence on path order is indirect, mainly through the Q-learning mechanism if their predictions correlate with the primary reward.  
  3. **End-to-End Training:** The entire system, including the router and experts, is trained end-to-end. If a particular order of expert activation consistently leads to better LM predictions and rewards, the gradients will flow back to encourage that sequence of routing decisions (primarily via the Q-values and router policy).

The idea is that the model should learn to create "reasoning chains" or "processing pipelines" by invoking experts in a meaningful order. Whether it successfully learns truly optimal or highly interpretable orders is an empirical question and a known challenge in such complex systems, but the architecture provides the framework for it.

# Novelty and Prior Work

This algorithm isn't built from entirely new primitives, but its **specific combination and orchestration of components, particularly the RL-guided sequential path generation through distinct expert modules with multiple auxiliary objectives and refined training techniques, presents a high degree of novelty or is at least a less common and sophisticated configuration.**

Closest Known Approaches & Comparisons:

* **Mixture of Experts (MoE):**  
  * **Similarity:** Uses multiple "expert" sub-networks and a gating/routing mechanism to select which ones to use.  
  * **Difference:**  
    * **Routing:** Standard MoE (e.g., Sparsely-Gated MoE by Shazeer et al.) typically has a single gating decision per layer, selecting a small number of experts whose outputs are combined (often a weighted sum). This GoE model performs *sequential* routing, forming a *path*.  
    * **Computation:** In MoE, selected experts often process the input in parallel. Here, it's sequential.  
    * **Router Training:** While MoE routers are trained, the explicit Q-learning (with path-penalized rewards, annealing discount), Gumbel-Softmax for exploration (with annealing temperature), and LayerNormed/clamped Q-augmented logits are more advanced/RL-flavored than typical MoE gates.  
* **Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) / PonderNet:**  
  * **Similarity:** Allows the model to learn how much computation to perform for different inputs, often by deciding how many times to apply a recurrent block or "ponder."  
  * **Difference:** ACT/PonderNet usually involve iteratively applying the *same* computational block. This GoE model selects from a pool of *different, specialized expert modules* at each step of the path. The "halting" mechanism in ACT (via a sigmoid) is analogous to the "terminate path" action in this GoE's router.  
* **Routing Networks / Conditional Computation Networks:**  
  * **Similarity:** These are broader terms. This GoE model is a specific instance of a conditional computation network.  
  * **Difference:** The novelty lies in the details: the sequential path construction, the RL-based router (with specific input summarization using mean+max pooling), the specific set of auxiliary losses (contrastive, diversity, path prediction), adaptive gates within experts, and sophisticated optimization (parameter-grouped LRs, dynamic LR adjustment).  
* **Google's Pathways Architecture (Conceptual):**  
  * **Similarity:** Pathways was envisioned as a single model that could be sparsely activated and learn to route tasks to different parts of itself. The "Graph-of-Experts" name and concept align well with this vision.  
  * **Difference:** Pathways is a very high-level architectural vision. This code provides a concrete, albeit smaller-scale, implementation of some of those ideas, with specific learning mechanisms.  
* **Reinforcement Learning for Model Control (e.g., NAS with RL controllers):**  
  * **Similarity:** Uses RL to make decisions about network structure or operation. The `RoutingController` is akin to an RL agent.  
  * **Difference:** Here, RL controls the dynamic data flow *within* a fixed parent architecture during inference/training on a task, rather than searching for a static architecture (as in NAS).  
* **Sequential Attention/Memory Models (e.g., variants of Neural Turing Machines):**  
  * **Similarity:** Involve a controller making sequential decisions to interact with internal states or memory.  
  * **Difference:** NTMs focus on explicit external memory. This GoE uses the evolving hidden state `active_x` as its "working memory" and the "operations" are the expert modules themselves.

The provided citations in the original prompt confirm that while individual elements (MoE, RL, dynamic routing) exist, their specific combination as a "Graph-of-Experts" with sequential path building, RL-controlled routing, auxiliary losses for diversity/specialization, and visualization tools is not explicitly detailed in those prior works.

The **novelty** of this GoE model, as implemented, lies in:

* The **dynamic, learned, sequential path construction** through *distinct* expert modules, where each expert can further adapt its output via an internal gate.  
* The **RL-inspired `RoutingController`** using Q-values (added to logits, then normalized and clamped), Gumbel-Softmax (with annealing tau) for training this sequential decision-making process, and a more informative input summary (mean \+ max pooling).  
* The **synergistic use of multiple auxiliary losses and reward shaping:**  
  * LM loss (main task)  
  * Router Q-loss (RL for path selection, with path-length penalized rewards and annealing discount factor)  
  * Router entropy (exploration, with annealing coefficient)  
  * Expert diversity/load balancing (efficient expert use)  
  * Expert contrastive loss (specialization of activated experts)  
  * Path property prediction losses (path regularization/guidance, using detached summaries)  
* The integration of this complex routing and expert system into a Transformer-like backbone for language modeling.  
* Sophisticated training techniques like parameter-specific learning rates and dynamic LR adjustment based on gradient norms.

While individual components have appeared elsewhere, their specific combination, interaction, and the refinements in this "Graph-of-Experts" framework for language modeling are advanced and push the boundaries of standard MoE or adaptive computation models. It's a sophisticated research-level architecture.

**1\. Abstract & Research Questions**

* **Abstract (Tentative):** Current large language models (LLMs) often employ a fixed computational graph, applying uniform processing to all inputs. This can be inefficient and may not optimally allocate resources. We introduce the Graph-of-Experts (GoE), a novel language model architecture that dynamically constructs sequential computational paths through a set of specialized expert modules. A reinforcement learning-guided router, trained with path-penalized rewards and sophisticated annealing schedules, determines the sequence and length of expert engagement for each input, aiming to optimize task performance while managing computational cost. Experts themselves feature adaptive gating mechanisms. We evaluate GoE on standard language modeling benchmarks, comparing it against dense Transformer and traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) baselines. Ablation studies investigate the contributions of the RL-router, auxiliary losses (contrastive, diversity, path optimization), expert design, and advanced optimization techniques. We further analyze learned path characteristics and evidence of expert specialization.  
* **Primary Research Questions (RQ):**  
  1. **RQ1 (Performance):** Can GoE achieve competitive or superior language modeling performance (e.g., perplexity) compared to well-tuned dense Transformers and MoE models with comparable parameter counts or computational budgets (FLOPs)?  
  2. **RQ2 (Adaptivity):** Does GoE learn to vary computational paths (length, expert sequence) in a meaningful way? Is there evidence of adaptive computation allocation, potentially influenced by the path length penalty in rewards?  
  3. **RQ3 (Component Efficacy):** How do the key components (RL-based router with its specific design, contrastive loss, diversity loss, path optimization losses, Gumbel-Softmax routing, adaptive expert gates, path penalty in reward, dynamic LR strategies) contribute to overall performance and learned behaviors?  
  4. **RQ4 (Expert Specialization):** Do the individual expert modules learn specialized functions or process distinct types of information, aided by contrastive loss and adaptive gating?

    * Design or select inputs targeting specific linguistic phenomena (e.g., syntactic complexity, semantic ambiguity, factual recall) to observe expert activation patterns and path choices.  
    * Analyze similarity of expert parameters (e.g., weights of `tag` or FFN layers).  
    * Cluster expert outputs (e.g., `active_x` after passing through an expert) for diverse inputs using dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE/UMAP) to see if different experts create separable representations.

**4\. Scientific Rigor & Reproducibility**

* **Statistical Significance:** Where appropriate, use statistical tests over multiple runs with different random seeds. Report mean and standard deviation for key results.  
* **Controlled Comparisons:** Ensure baselines are fair (parameter/FLOP matching). Clearly document any differences.  
* **Code Release:**  
  * Publish well-documented code on a platform like GitHub under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).  
  * Include dependency files (`requirements.txt` or Conda environment).  
  * Provide scripts and instructions to reproduce experiments (e.g., detailing HPs for reported results).  
* **Model Checkpoints:** Release pre-trained model weights for key experiments (e.g., on Hugging Face Hub).  
* **Data Availability:** Use publicly available datasets. Provide links and preprocessing details.  
* **Experiment Tracking:** Use tools like Weights & Biases for logging all hyperparameters, metrics, and system environment details. Share public links to key experiment dashboards. The current GUI provides a good starting point for local tracking.

**5\. Communication & Publication Plan**

* **Target Venues (depending on results maturity):**  
  * **Top-Tier ML Conferences:** NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR.  
  * **Top-Tier NLP Conferences:** ACL, EMNLP, NAACL.  
  * **Workshops:** Relevant workshops at the above conferences for earlier-stage results or focused contributions.  
  * **Preprint:** arXiv submission upon obtaining robust results.  
* **Paper Structure:** Standard scientific paper format (Introduction, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Results, Analysis, Conclusion).  
* **Clarity and Comprehensibility:**  
  * Use clear, concise language. Define all terms and notation.  
  * Provide high-quality figures and tables.  
  * Explain the rationale behind design choices (e.g., why mean+max pooling for router, why adaptive gates).  
* **Iteration:** Seek feedback from peers, present findings internally, and revise based on critiques.

**6\. Research Stages (Iterative Process)**

* **Stage 1: Setup, Refinement & Initial Prototyping**  
  * Refine model code (if needed for external logging/HPO frameworks), implement robust external logging, and set up the HPO framework.  
  * Conduct initial HPO and experiments on a smaller dataset with a compact GoE configuration and baselines to debug and validate the entire pipeline.  
* **Stage 2: Core Experiments & Hyperparameter Optimization**  
  * Transition to the main evaluation dataset.  
  * Perform extensive HPO for the GoE model and all baseline models.  
  * Execute main performance comparison experiments to address RQ1.  
  * Begin systematic ablation studies to address RQ3.  
* **Stage 3: In-depth Analysis & Completion of Ablations**  
  * Finalize all ablation studies.  
  * Conduct comprehensive analyses of learned paths, expert utilization, and potential specialization to address RQ2 and RQ4.  
  * Begin drafting the research paper, focusing on methods and initial results.  
* **Stage 4: Paper Finalization, Code Release & Submission**  
  * Consolidate all experimental results and analyses.  
  * Write, revise, and polish the full research paper.  
  * Prepare the codebase, model checkpoints, and experimental setup for public release according to open-science best practices.  
  * Submit the manuscript to the chosen publication venue.

**7\. Ethical Considerations & Broader Impact**

* Acknowledge computational costs and discuss how GoE's adaptive nature (and path length penalties) might contribute to efficiency.  
* Address potential biases from training data, common to all LMs.  
* Discuss potential misuse and safety considerations.  
* Highlight positive impacts, such as potential for more energy-efficient and accessible LLMs if adaptivity leads to significant computational savings for many inputs.
